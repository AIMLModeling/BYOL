# BYOL
Self-supervised learning is a machine learning process where the model trains itself to learn one part of the input from another part of the input. It is also known as predictive or pretext learning.Â  In this process, the unsupervised problem is transformed into a supervised problem by auto-generating the labels. To make use of the huge quantity of unlabeled data, it is crucial to set the right learning objectives to get supervision from the data itself. I compared self-supervised and unsupervised learning along with other machine learning methods. Then I demonstrated how to build self supervised learning model with BYOL method in Python.
